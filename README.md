### AutoCAD application that finds corresponding solids and collects them into blocks.
### Currently only collects valves blocks (consist of 2 cones or 1 box, 1 torus, 1 cylinder).

Runs on *F# .NET Framework* 4.8.

To execute type *CollectBlocks* in AutoCAD command line.
Then type in solids layer name.

Will probably add other types of blocks to collect later.
